SAMBA CONFIGURATION
What is Samba?
    • Samba is a suite of Unix applications that speak the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.
    • Windows and Unix operating system use SMB to perform client-server networking for file and printer sharing and associated operations.
Creating a Basic smb.conf File
The following is a minimal configuration for a Samba standalone server:
[global]
        map to guest = Bad User
        log file = /var/log/samba/%m
        log level = 1
[guest]
        # This share allows anonymous (guest) access
        # without authentication!
        path = /srv/samba/guest/
        read only = no
        guest ok = yes
[demo]
        # This share requires authentication to access
        path = /srv/samba/demo/
        read only = no
        guest ok = no

The default workgroup name 'WORKGROUP' will be used.

If you are not planning to enable anonymous (guest) access to shares, remove the[map to guest]parameter or set it to[Never](default).

Creating a Local User Account
Create a demoUser account on the local system:
useradd -M -s /sbin/nologin demoUser
Omit the -M parameter if the user requires a home directory on this host.
to enable the demoUser account on the local system:
passwd demoUser
Enter new UNIX password: Passw0rd
Retype new UNIX password: Passw0rd
passwd: password updated successfully
Setting a local password is required to enable the account.

Add the demoUser account to the Samba database:
mbpasswd -a demoUser
New SMB password: Passw0rd
Retype new SMB password: Passw0rd
Added user demoUser.
The password assigned in these steps is the one used by the user to log in to the domain.

To enable the Samba account:
# smbpasswd -e demoUser
Enabled user demoUser.

Local Group Management
To create a demoGroup group:
# groupadd demoGroup
To add the demoUser account to the group:
# usermod -aG demoGroup demoUser
Creating the Shared Directories
To create the shares directories:
# mkdir -p /srv/samba/guest/
# mkdir -p /srv/samba/demo/

Setting ACLs on the Shared Directories
Set the following POSIX permissions:
# chgrp -R demoGroup /srv/samba/guest/
# chgrp -R demoGroup /srv/samba/demo/

# chmod 2775 /srv/samba/guest/
# chmod 2770 /srv/samba/demo/
This configures write access to members of the demoGroup group in both directories. Other users have read access in the /srv/samba/guest/ and no access in the /srv/samba/demo/ directory. The SGID bit - represented by the first bit (2) in the mode set on the directories

Starting Samba
Start the smbd daemon:
# smbd

Testing the Share Access

[root@samba home]# smbclient -U demo //192.168.39.145/admin
Enter WORKGROUP\demo's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls

  ..                                  D        0  Wed Jan 30 05:16:03 2019

smb: \> 
Access the demo share as guest. The access is denied:

[root@samba home]# smbclient -U test1 //192.168.39.145/admin
Enter WORKGROUP\test1's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls
